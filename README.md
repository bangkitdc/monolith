## How to Run
Before you run this project locally, you can copy .env.example into .env and then set the environment. After that, run it with docker.
```sh
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
```
It will automatically migrate and seed the database.

After that, if you want to connect this container to the single service container, you have to make a network between the 2 containers on the docker by applying this command on your terminal.
```sh
    docker network create my_network
    docker network connect my_network app_monolith
    docker network connect my_network go-app
```

I use go-app for the single service container and app_monolith for the monolith app.
